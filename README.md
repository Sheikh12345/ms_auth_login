# ms_auth_login

In which i used the official microsoft login android plugin version 3.+,

consists of 4 method init(), login(), silentToken(), and signOut(),

you can access all the method by using MsAuthLogin class.

first you need to call init method. in which you have to pass or required parameters are clientId,
redirectUri, tenantId and resourceId.

after that you can call login() and then silentToken() function.
